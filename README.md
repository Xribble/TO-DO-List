# TO-DO-List
Introduction:
The project is a TO-DO list application built using Django, a Python web framework. 
It incorporates user authentication to ensure secure access to user-specific tasks. Users can register an account, log in, and manage their tasks by creating, updating, and deleting them. 
The application includes access control to protect user data. With this project, users can effectively organize and track their tasks while maintaining the privacy and security of their information.

How-To
To run the TO-DO list application with user authentication, follow these steps:
1.	Install Python: Ensure that Python is installed on your system. You can download the latest version of Python from the official Python website (https://www.python.org) and follow the installation instructions.
2.	Install Django: Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install Django using pip, the Python package manager:
Copy
   pip install django
3.	Download the project: Download the project files or clone the repository from the source where the TO-DO list application with user authentication is hosted.
4.	Navigate to the project directory: Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you downloaded or cloned the project.
5.	Set up the database: By default, Django uses SQLite as the database backend. Run the following command to create the necessary database tables:
Copy
   python manage.py migrate
6.	Create a superuser: To access the admin panel and manage users, create a superuser account by running the following command and following the prompts:
  		 python manage.py createsuperuser
7.	Run the development server: Start the development server by running the following command:
   	python manage.py runserver
8.	Access the application: Open a web browser and visit http://localhost:8000 to access the TO-DO list application.
9.	Register and log in: Create a new account by clicking on the "Register" link and providing the required information. After registration, log in using your credentials.
10.	Manage tasks: Once logged in, you can create, update, and delete tasks in the TO-DO list application.
By following these steps, you should be able to run the TO-DO list application with user authentication locally on your machine.


Authentication flow:
1.	User Registration:
  •	The user visits the registration page of the TO-DO list application.
  •	The user provides their desired username and password.
  •	The application validates the input data and creates a new user account in the database using Django's built-in authentication system.
2.	User Login:
  •	The user visits the login page of the TO-DO list application.
  •	The user provides their username/email and password.
  •	The application verifies the provided credentials against the stored user data in the local database.
  •	If the credentials are valid, the user is authenticated and granted access to their account.
3.	Access Control:
  •	Once the user is authenticated, they can access their TO-DO list and perform actions like creating or deleting tasks.
  •	The application checks the user's authentication status on each request to ensure they have the necessary permissions to perform the requested action.
  •	If the user is not authenticated, they may be redirected to the login page or denied access to certain features.
4.	User Logout:
  •	The user can choose to log out of their account.
  •	The application clears the user's session and logs them out, preventing further access to protected resources.
These steps outline authentication flow for a TO-DO list application.

Summary: 
This project is a robust TO-DO list application developed using Django, a powerful Python web framework. 
It offers a seamless user experience with features like user authentication, allowing users to create personalized accounts, log in securely, and manage their tasks effortlessly. 
The application prioritizes data privacy and security through access control mechanisms, ensuring that users can confidently organize and track their tasks while safeguarding their sensitive information.
